As said earlier, this is a place for me to drop my little projects in. In doing so, i'll have somewhere i can look my progress from.

RockPaperScissors, PIG, MadlibsGenerator and TurtleRace are minigame projects based on the idea of the following video, only i decided make it without using the creator's code. As such, do not be surprised if the code is different !

The Slot Machine project idea was initialised by the same video, however i decided it would be a more unique project if i truly made it my own. Therefore, i decided
to make the rules based on my imagination's version of the game, and did it all by myself. I also added a file to write all my function into for clarity sake, as
well as a way to challenge myself to re-try more diverse coding style.

Thank you for your attention, have a good day !

PS: French is my native language, therefore it is more than likely that this readme file has some english errors... feel free to let me know !
