As said earlier, this is a place for me to drop my little projects in. In doing so, i'll have somewhere i can look my progress from.

RockPaperScissors and PIG are minigames project based on the idea of the following video, only i decided make it without using the creator's code. As such, do not be surprised if the code is different!

PS: French is my native language, therfore it is more than likely that this readme has some english errors... feel free to let me know !
